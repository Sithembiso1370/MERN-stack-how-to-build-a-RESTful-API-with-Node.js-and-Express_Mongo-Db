The controllers folder could also be named API as it serves the routes/endpoints for our server. Once we have the user requesting HTTPS methods on those endpoints we will direct those requests to the database through our Mongoose model as you will see in the code.
It works as follows: the user interacts with the frontend, we receive an event through it that triggers our server's backend through the api we have designed, the api then interacts with the database through the different models. The database sends back the information to the server and the server sends it back to the frontend.
