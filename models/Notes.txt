Mongoose Schema
Let's start with the models folder.
 Inside we will put the schema of our data. 
 Object databases don't need schemas however it's always good practice to have one. 
 If you don't want to dig into databases right now just know that here you are defining a model of the data your database will be storing.
The easiest way to interact with MongoDB is the mongoose library.
